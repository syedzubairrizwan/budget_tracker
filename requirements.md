 limits. 
 
 Financial Goals: The app will support the creation and tracking of multiple financial goals, such as saving for a down payment, a vacation, or debt repayment. Progress will be visualized to motivate users.

 Spending Analysis & Insights: Beyond basic reporting, the AI will provide proactive, personalized insights into spending behavior. This includes identifying areas where users can save money, suggesting alternative spending habits, and offering actionable financial advice tailored to their unique situation.
